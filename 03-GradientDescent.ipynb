    "One cannot overstate the importance \"Gradient descent\" in the field of machine learning. It's an optimization technique that lies in the heart of machine learning algorithm ranging from regression to deep learning. This chapter aims to provide intuition behind the gradient descent algorithm and it's variant. Similar to previous chapters, I work through examples and code in order to build a concrete understanding of the concept. \n",

    "## Finding Minimum Using Brute Force\n",
    "Assume a two dimensional function $f(X)=x_0^2 + x_1^2$. Now let's assume we want to find the value of $X=(x_0, x_1)$ at which f(X) is minimum. A natural instinct would be to plot the function for some random range of X and observe the behavior of $f(X)$. Using plotly, below code snippet renders the above function. "

    "As humans, we can do this naturally as long as we can visualize the function.  However, a typical machine learning problem will involve hundreds of features. So let's think how did we so easily find the point X at which $f(X)$ is minimum. One possible explanation is that our eyes randomly picked a point on the above surface and followed in the direction where the slope is decreasing. Finally, when the slop starts increasing again we know that we have crossed the minimum point. Let's try to transfer this idea into a proper python code. The logical flow of the problem will be as follows:\n",

    "**Step 1:** Pick a random point $X = (x_0, x_1)$\n",
    "**Step 2:** Identify the next point $X'$ such as that $f(X') < f(X)$. However, one challenge is how do we find $X'$. Let's start with some brute force. Assume we look for neighboring points that are $\\eta$ distance away on a single dimension.  For instance, as shown below figure (a), let's assume $X=[1,1]$ and $\\eta = 0.25$. Then, the neighboring points to explore are [1-0.25, 1], [1 + 0.25, 1], [1, 1-0.25], [1, 1 + 0.25]. Thus, if X is n dimensional vector then there will be $2^n$ neighbors to explore. If we relax the constraint that one can only move $\\eta$ distance along on one dimension at any given time, then we have additional four diagonal points as shown in the figure: [1-0.25, 1-0.25], [1+0.25, 1-0.25], [1-0.25, 1+0.25], [1+0.25, 1+0.25]. For n dimensional space then there will be $3^n$ neighboring points.\n",

    "## Using Gradient Approach\n",
    "Great, now we have working function. But it's not scalable. If you have n dimensionals pace, there are $3^n$ possible neighbors that we need to explore (this is assuming that we are taking $\\eta$ distance along each dimension). One way to solve the above scalability issue is use the concept of directional derivative and gradients. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of step 2 is to find $X'$ for which $f(X')$ is smallest. This is exactly the kind of information that derivative provides. For instance, our function $f(X)=x_0^2 + x_1^2$ has two parameters: $x_0, x_1$. So partial derivative of our function $f(x)$, written as $\\Delta{f(X)}$ is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta{f(X)} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x_0}}\\\\ \n",
    "\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x_1}}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "2x_0\\\\\n",
    "2x_1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The partial derivative gives the direction of steepest gradient. Since we are interested in minimization, we want to move opposite to the direction of greatest gradient. Thus, rather than having to explore $3^n$ points, we can essentially find $X'$ using the below formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X' = X - \\eta \\Delta{f(X)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things to note in the above equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\Delta{f(X)}$ gives the direction of steepest gradient. Since we want to minimize, we want to go in the opposite direction of steepest gradient and hence \"minus\" sign. \n",
    "2. $\\Delta{f(X)}$ is a unit vector. If we directly do $X - \\Delta{f(X)}$ then we are finding neighbors in opposite direction of steepest gradient that is at a distance of one unit from the current point X. A jump of one unit might be too much and hence we dampen it by multipling by $\\eta$. Often **$\\eta$ is referreed as the learning rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the gradient approach, let's write the second version of minimization method. Note that below, the func now doesn't refer to the original function ($x_0^2 + x_1^2$) but to it's derivative i.e. ($2x_0 + 2x1$).\n",

    "Gradient descent algorithm is still an active area of research. There are many aspects of the algorithm that influences its performance both in terms of running time and accuracy. For instance, I didn't really talk much about the impact of learning rate on the performance and accuracy of the gradient descent approach. A small learning rate increases running time but improves accuracy and vice-versa. However, learning rate doesn't have to constant. There are many variants of the gradient descent algorithm where learning rate is dynamically modified based on number of iteration, steepness of gradient, etc. Hence, I would recomment think about following things:\n",
