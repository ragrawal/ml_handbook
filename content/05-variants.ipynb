    "# Gradient Descent Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the immense importance of the gradient descent algorithm, it has remained an active topic of exploration in order to increase it's speed. This chapter shows the evolution of gradient descent from vanilla batch gradient descent that we developed in the previous chapter to RMSProp. Similar to previous chapter, rather than using libraries, the focus is to implement these variants in python for better learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare the performance of different versions of gradient descent, I construct a toy dataset, a 2D parabola and demonstrate how each iteration of the algorithm is able to reduce MSE in fewer iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have a fair comparison, below script construct a toy dataset and the same starting point. Further, I try to keep most of the hyper parameters such as learning rate, stopping criteria, etc. to be static. The toy dataset is a 2D parabola generated using the following equation: $y=100 + 4x_1^2 + 2x_2^2$. The aim of the gradient descent algorithm and it's variant is to estimate the three coefficients: 100, 4 and 2. The three coefficients are represents by vector $\\theta$.\n"

We will use this algorithm to establish the baseline for evaluating different variants of the gradient descent algorithm. The evaluation of various algorithms will be based on how quickly the MSE reduces. The faster it reduces, the better is the algorithm. We compute MSE after each pass through the whole dataset, also known as epoch, and keep track of the iteration number, associated parameters and MSE in Traceback object. "

    "## Mini Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges with batch gradient descent is that it has to go through the whole dataset before it can update the parameters. While this has the advantage where our gradient doesn't randomly switches direction, it tends to converge to the local minimum slowly. Mini batch gradient descent address this by splitting the data into smaller chunks and updating the parameter for each chunk. Assuming we divide the data into 10 chunks then in a single pass through our data, or single epoch, our parameters will get updated 10 times. Below is the implementation of mini batch gradient descent. The only difference between this version and the previous version is that we had an additional parameter `num_batches`. In each epoch, we randomly split the data into mini chunks and update the parameters as we go through each of them. "

    "As compared to Batch Gradient Descent, Mini Batch is much faster. But it still leaves room for improvment.  Think of a ball rolling down the hill. As long as the ball is rolling in one direction, it gains velocity but as soon as it changes direction, it's velocity reduces. Another way to think about this is looking at component vectors of the gradient as shown in the image below. Let's assume we computed the gradient at pt A and then pt B. If we look at the component vectors of the gradient at the two points, the two are in the same direction and thus it indicates that we are going in the right direction and ideally should move even more faster. But as we move from point B to C, the horizontal component vector are in the opposite direction and therefore indicates that we should now slow down. \n",

    "Thus, one idea is to adjust the vector scomponents of the gradient based on the previously observed values of the gradient. In Momentum gradient descent, we use exponentially average. Essentially, the last observed gradient descent has the weight of $\\beta$. The one before that has the weight of $\\beta^2$ and so on. In other words, the effective gradient is computed in the following manner:\n",

    "$$g = \\beta g + (1-\\beta)\\frac{\\delta{X}}{\\delta{\\theta}}$$\n",

    "RMSProp was one of the major development and fueled the growth of deep learning. While momentum leveraged historical gradients to speed up the gradient descent algorithm, one still has to provide right learning rate. RMSProp addresses this problem by automatically adjusting learning rate along each component of the gradient descent. You can find a good introduction of the methodology over [here](https://blog.paperspace.com/intro-to-optimization-momentum-rmsprop-adam/). The key equations are:\n",

While RMSProp tends to often perform better, certain situations might require a different variants such as NAD, Adam, etc. A good summary of different variants of gradient descent is available over [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/gradient-descent-algorithm-and-its-variants-10f652806a3).
